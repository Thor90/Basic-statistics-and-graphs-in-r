# Basic-statistics-and-graphs-using-r

I'd to share some of the codes that I think useful for data cleaning. 

1. Showcase descriptive statistics
2. Data manipulation
3. Data tranformation
4. Basic graphs
  - Barplots
  - Pie chart
  - Stem-and-leaf Chart
  - Histograms
  - Box-and-whisker plots
  - QQ-plot and QQ-line
  - Scatterplot

Declares
- x = independent variable (n=1...n)
- y = dependent variable (n=1...n)
- dataset = file name of the dataset (e.g., iyres.csv)
- aa, bb, cc, dd... = things that I used to assign
